### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a PhD in the field of neuroscience and neuroimaging (University of Birmingham). During my PhD, I worked at the Centre for Human Brain Health and at the Wellington Hospital (London) and explored the effects of Brain stimulation on the motor network, and as a therapeutic tool for disorders of consciousness (i.e., vegetative state). My projects involved both healthy and clinical data analyses (functional MRI, structural MRI, EEG, clinical scales).


## Last PhD project:
- I investigated the relationship between connectivity changes in the brain following brain stimulation (tDCS), and electric field characteristics as estimated by MRI-derived models ([repository](https://github.com/Davi93/wp1_2_roast)). 
- I am also reorganising all the functions and scripts I wrote during my PhD ([repository](https://github.com/Davi93/mri_scripts)). These are mainly MRI utilities or functions to visualise data / results from MRI/fMRI analyses. I will likely work on this project more once I finish with my PhD thesis.

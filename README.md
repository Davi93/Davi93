### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Doctoral Researcher at the Centre for Human Brain Health (Birmingham, UK) working in the field of neuroimaging and neuroscience. I am interested in computer programming, health data science and data visualisation. I am currently working on Disorders of Consciousness (such as vegetative state or coma), and I am studying new possible therapeutic approaches using techniques as MRI, EEG and non-invasive brain stimulation. 

## Ongoing projects:
- I am currently investigating the relationship between connectivity changes in the brain following brain stimulation, and electric field characteristics estimated by MRI-derived models ([repository](https://github.com/Davi93/wp1_2_roast)). 
- I am also reorganising all the functions and scripts I wrote during my PhD ([repository](https://github.com/Davi93/mri_scripts)). These are mainly MRI utilities or functions to visualise data / results from MRI/fMRI analyses. I'm still working on this.
- [Brain pathology classification using FastAI](https://github.com/Davi93/idmlp_project): this is a very simple project for the course Introduction to Deep (Machine) Learning for Physicists 2022 (University of Warwick).
